# 🧠 AI Agents Collection

This repository is a growing collection of simple and useful AI agents built using [Google's Gemini API](https://ai.google.dev/) and interactive Python tools like `ipywidgets`.

Each agent serves a unique purpose — from generating tweets to assisting with health-related queries. The goal is to build a modular and extensible framework for creating smart assistants using natural language capabilities.
